# My Simbirsoft Test App

This is my test app. 
It shows weather details of users current location based on https://openweathermap.org/ API.
I also would like to expand my apps capability to have an opportunity of searching desired cities weather.
Unfortunately, didnt have time to make it happen for now.


Thank you for checking out my work! It was a pleasure for me to work on it. It is important to me,
to have such incredible chance to be a part of your students team!
I'm sure it will be an enormous boost in my skills and understandig how real IT world flows)

I understand that i dont have enough expirience in order to make high quality web apps, but if there is something i dont know,
i'm ready to learn it)
I'll be glad to hear any feedback on my test app as well as your recommendation for my future studies!
